Swipe My Ride

This app creates a fresh new way for people to browse new or used cars to purchase. It allows users to swipe left or right on a picture
according to their preferences. They will be able to set their own preferences from the preferences page. Any cars that has been swiped
right on will then be transferred onto the database called "The Crib" where the user can view all the cars they've chosen and take
further actions on them. Actions can involve seeing additional details about the vehicle and also message the user selling the car to
meet up with them or seal the deal. As of now, the app will not be processing any payments and all cars listed on the app will be mainly
user generated. In the future, we plan to add a word scraping functionality to procure cars from different websites (with their permission).

How to use the app:

1. MainScreen.dart displays the images of the cars for the user to view.
2. Users will have the ability to save the car into the GarageApp.dart page to view later.
3. Users can then interact with the saved cars further by messaging the person selling the car or viewing extra details about it.
4. Users will also be able to set their preferences to find cars matching the preferences criteria.


Conclusion:

The purpose of this app is to make purchasing cars and sellings cars easier for users as the current way to do this is quite clunky.
